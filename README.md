## Hasenpfeffer Heist
#### Become the chubbiest bunny in the meadow when you face off against the other buns to steal the most from the garden - but don't get caught!

### Game Flow
#### Objective 
Earn the most points by the end of the game. Players earn points
by collecting vegetables which each have an associated 
point value. Vegetables can be dug up from the garden or stolen from another player. If the player is caught digging, a strike occurs.
The game ends after three strikes and players lose whatever vegetables are in their paws. 

#### Set up 
1. All players enter name
2. All players select a rabbit
3. All players select a favourite vegetable
4. One player generates a room
5. Other players join using that room code
6. Players enter room and are added to the players list 
   on the main game screen

#### Taking turns
On a turn,
1. player starts with actions `Dig`, `End Turn`, and whatever actions were collected during previous turns.
2. When a player performs action `Dig`, they will randomly find a vegetable, action, or strike.
3. Vegetables found are added to paws. If both of two paws are full, the player may choose to drop one of the vegetables they are holding. 
4. Player can also perform a `Steal` action to steal a vegetable from another player. If this player has a `Block` action, the `Steal` is unsuccessful.
5. Player can also perform a `Stash` action to move a vegetable from the paws to the burrow. 
6. A strike will cause the player to drop the vegetables they are holding and end their turn. (alternates to explore: only drop on the 3rd strike, don't end their turn, not three strikes but instead every player can keep going until they get one strike but then they are out of the game)
